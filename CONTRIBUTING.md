## Development Setup

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid using `any` type
- Use ESLint for code quality

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables/Functions**: camelCase (`getUserData`)
- **Classes/Components**: PascalCase (`UserProfile`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_URL`)
- **Files**: camelCase for logic (`authController.ts`), PascalCase for components (`LoginForm.tsx`)

### Code Style
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings (except JSON)
- Add semicolons at the end of statements
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

### Git Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add course enrollment feature
fix: resolve authentication token expiry issue
docs: update API documentation for assignments
refactor: simplify user authentication logic
test: add unit tests for course controller
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Title**: Use conventional commit format
2. **Description**: 
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes were necessary
   - How to test the changes
3. **Tests**: Include tests for new features
4. **Documentation**: Update docs if needed
5. **Screenshots**: Include for UI changes

### Code Review Process

1. PRs require at least one approval
2. All CI checks must pass
3. Address reviewer feedback promptly
4. Keep PRs focused and small
5. Rebase on main if needed
